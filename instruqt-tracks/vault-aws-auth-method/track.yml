title: AWS Auth Method for Vault
teaser: Authenticate to Vault using the AWS Auth Method for IAM.
description: |-
  The `aws` auth method provides an automated mechanism to retrieve a Vault token
  for IAM principals and AWS EC2 instances. Securely provide your AWS-based
  applications password-less access to secrets stored in HashiCorp Vault.

  In this track you'll use the built in AWS IAM infrastructure to provide
  access to the Vault API. This makes it easy to provide secure secrets
  management to your AWS resources with minimal setup and hassle.

  title: Enable the AWS Auth Method
  teaser: Prepare Vault to accept AWS IAM for authentication.
  assignment: |-
    You have been automatically logged into Vault using the
    [root token](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens/#root-tokens).

    At any time during this track, you can view your root token at `/root/token`.

    ```
    cat /root/token
    ```

    If you open up the Vault UI tab and use this token, you can log into the UI and
    take a look around.

    This token will be valid for the duration of the track. Typically, you'll
    `export` that token value as your `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable, however,
    you should not do that for this track.

    ---

    All auth methods in Vault must be enabled before they can be used. Take a
    look at what auth methods are currently enabled.

    ```
    vault auth list
    ```

    Note that there is only one auth method enabled (`token`). Enable the `aws`
    auth method.

    ```
    vault auth enable aws
    ```

    If you list the auth methods again, you should now be able to see both `aws`
    and `token`.

      Auth methods are the components in Vault that perform authentication
      and are responsible for assigning identity and a set of policies to a user.

      There are two authentication methods present for the
      [AWS auth method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws/) in Vault:
      `iam` and `ec2`.

      This challenge will focus on the `iam` authentication type. With the `iam` method,
      a special AWS request signed with AWS IAM credentials is used for authentication
      to Vault.

  title: Configure the AWS IAM Auth Method
  teaser: Configures the credentials required to perform successful API calls to AWS
    from Vault.
  assignment: |-
    After enabling the AWS auth method, you must configure it to authenticate and
    communicate with AWS. You have been provided an AWS account and credentials with the
    [HashiCorp recommended IAM policy](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws#recommended-vault-iam-policy)
    attached, so no need to use your own.

    The provided credentials can be found in the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
    `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables. Feel free to take a peek at them.

    ```
    echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    ```

    Configure the AWS auth method to use the credentials that have been
    provided to you.

    ```
    vault write auth/aws/config/client \
      access_key=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
      secret_key=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    ```

    The `iam` auth method allows you to specify a list of "bound IAM principal ARNs".
    Clients authenticating to Vault must have an ARN that matches one of the
    ARNs bound to the IAM role they are attempting to login to. The bound ARN
    allows specifying a wildcard at the end of the bound ARN.

    For example, if the bound ARN were `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:*` it would allow
    any principal in the AWS account `123456789012` to login to it. Similarly,
    if it were `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/*` it would allow any IAM role
    in the AWS account to login to it. If you wish to specify a wildcard, you must
    give Vault `iam:GetUser` and `iam:GetRole` permissions to properly resolve the
    full user path.

    Now you're ready to configure Vault to communicate with your account, and you
    do that by configuring the role that you'll eventually log in with later.
    Be sure to name the role `my-role-iam`, and for the sake of simplicity, you
    should configure the `bound_iam_pricipal_arn` to be a wildcard for all principals
    in your provided AWS account.

    ```
    vault write auth/aws/role/my-role-iam \
      auth_type=iam \
      bound_iam_principal_arn=arn:aws:iam::$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:* \
      policies=developer \
      token_ttl=30m \
      token_max_ttl=30m
    ```

    You should also configure the `iam_server_id_header_value`, to help prevent
    replay attacks.

    ```
    vault write auth/aws/config/client \
      iam_server_id_header_value=instruqt.vault.example.com
    ```

    Vault is now successfully configured for AWS IAM authentication.

      When enabled, auth methods are similar to secrets engines. They are
      mounted within the Vault mount table and can be accessed and configured
      using the standard read/write API. All auth methods are mounted underneath
      the `auth/` prefix.

      The [AWS STS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)
      includes a method, [`sts:GetCallerIdentity`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetCallerIdentity.html),
      which allows you to validate the identity of a client. The client signs a
      `GetCallerIdentity` query using the AWS Signature v4 algorithm and submits
      4 pieces of information to the Vault server to recreate a valid signed
      request (the request URL, the request body, the request headers, and the
      request method). The AWS signature is computed over those fields. The Vault
      server then reconstructs the query and forwards it on to the AWS STS service
      and validates the result back.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Each signed AWS request includes the current timestamp to mitigate the risk
      of replay attacks. In addition, Vault allows you to require an additional
      header, `X-Vault-AWS-IAM-Server-ID`, to be present to mitigate against
      different types of replay attacks (such as a signed `GetCallerIdentity`
      request stolen from a dev Vault instance and used to authenticate to a prod
      Vault instance).

      Vault further requires that this header be one of the headers included in
      the AWS signature and relies upon AWS to authenticate that signature.

  title: Log In Using the AWS IAM Auth Method
  teaser: Generate a signed AWS API request that will validate against AWS and log
    you into Vault.
  assignment: |-
    You are ready to perform the login operation.

    ```
    vault login \
      -method=aws \
      header_value=instruqt.vault.example.com \
      role=my-role-iam
    ```

    Note that above we specify `header_value` and `role`, but we did not
    explicitly pass any credentials to the login command.

    That is because the Vault client will look for credentials in environment
    variables, then in `~/.aws/credentials`, IAM instance profile, or ECS task role,
    in that order. In this case, you didn't have to enter anything because
    `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are already set in the
    environment.

    You can always specify the credentials `aws_access_key_id`,
    `aws_secret_access_key` and `aws_security_token` as arguments of the `login`
    command, but this is not recommended.

    Take the `token` value that you received in the response from Vault and
    paste it into the text field in the Vault UI tab, using the Token method. You
    should be able to log into the Vault UI.

    Move back to the CLI, and confirm that you are no longer logged in with the root
    token by running the following command.

    ```
    vault auth list
    ```

    Now that you are no longer using the root token, you cannot list the auth
    methods in Vault, as you no longer have the right permissions.

      The `iam` auth method authenticates AWS IAM principals. This can include IAM
      users, IAM roles assumed from other accounts, AWS Lambdas that are
      launched in an IAM role, or even EC2 instances that are launched in an
      IAM instance profile.

      The `iam` auth method authenticates by having clients provide a specially
      signed AWS API request which the method then passes on to AWS to validate
      the signature and tell Vault who created it. Upon successful authentication,
      a Vault token will be returned to you.

      The actual secret (i.e., the AWS secret access key) is never transmitted
      over the wire, and the AWS signature algorithm automatically expires
      requests after 15 minutes, providing simple and robust protection against
      replay attacks.

  assignment: |-
    Now you are ready to perform the logout operation, by removing your
    cached Vault token.

    ```
    rm ~/.vault-token
    ```

    With your cached Vault token removed, you will no longer be authenticated to Vault.
    Confirm this by trying to list all the auth methods one more time.

    ```
    vault auth list
    ```

    You should see a missing client token error.

    *You are done!*

    If you would like to log back into Vault and keep playing around, re-export
    the root token.

    ```
    export VAULT_TOKEN=$(cat /root/token)

    vault auth list
    ```

    The auth methods Vault provides let you choose the most appropriate authentication
    mechanism for your organization. In this track, you learned about the AWS
    authentication method. For more options and details, visit the
    [AWS auth method docs](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws/).
  notes:

      The `vault` CLI also uses a "token helper" to cache the token after
      authentication.

      This is conceptually similar to how a website securely stores your session
      information as a cookie in the browser. Token helpers are customizable,
      and you can even build your own.

      The default token helper stores the token in `~/.vault-token`. You can
      delete this file at any time to "logout" of Vault.
