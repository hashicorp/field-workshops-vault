title: Vault KMIP Secrets Engine for MongoDB Encryption (ADP)
teaser: Help implement the "Assumed Breach" principal of a Zero Trust methodology
  by leveraging Vault’s KMIP Secret engine to encrypt all MongoDB Enterprise data.
description: |-
  The KMIP secrets engine allows Vault to act as a Key Management Interoperability
  Protocol (KMIP) server provider and handle the lifecycle of its KMIP managed objects.

  In track we will leverage this KMIP secrets engine for external MongoDB encryption key management.
  A few other examples (not included here) are, MySQL Enterprise, VSphere VMs and VSANs.

  This encryption workflow protects against the scenario where an adversary has gained privileged
  access to the Linux/Windows box running the database. In this case, they may only have
  permissions to inspect database files on the host and are not actually logged into the database itself.
