title: Vault ADP with Tokenization
teaser: Leverage Vault's Transform Secrets Engine (Tokenization) for protecting customer PII data.
description: |-
  The Vault Transform Secrets Engine provides the ability to tokenize sensitive data for storing outside of Vault.

  When encrypting sensitive data, preservation of the original data format or length may be required to meet certain industry standards such as HIPAA or PCI.
  To fulfill this requirement, the Transform Secrets Engine can perform format preserving encryption (FPE).

  However, there are organizations that care more about the irreversibility of the tokenized data and not so much about preserving the original data format.
  Therefore, the Transform Secrets Engine's FPE transformation may not meet the governance, risk and compliance (GRC) strategy they are looking for due to the use of reversible cryptography to perform FPE.

  In this lab, you will use the Transform Secrets Engine with an example Golang application and external Postgres database.
