title: Vault Basics
teaser: Learn how to setup and run a Vault server and manage its secrets.
description: |-
  Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, or certificates. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

  Vault tightly controls access to secrets by authenticating against trusted sources of identity such as Active Directory, LDAP, Kubernetes, CloudFoundry, and cloud platforms. Vault enables fine grained authorization of which users and applications are permitted access to secrets.

  This track will introduce you to the Community Edition of Vault, starting with the Vault CLI and running a Vault dev server and moving on to running a Vault production server, enabling the KV secrets engine and Userpass auth method, and using Vault policies to restrict which secrets different users can access.
