  title: Enable the AWS Secrets Engine
  teaser: Prepare Vault to generate dynamic credentials for AWS.
  assignment: |-
    The AWS secrets engine generates AWS access credentials dynamically based on
    IAM policies. This generally makes working with AWS IAM easier, since it does
    not involve clicking around the AWS management console.

    The AWS IAM credentials are time-bound and are automatically revoked when the
    Vault lease expires. The credentials can also be revoked at any time. You'll
    learn how to do that in a later challenge.

    All secrets engines must be enabled before they can be used. Take a look at
    what secrets engines are currently enabled.

    ```
    vault secrets list
    ```

    Note that the AWS secrets engine is not enabled. You should enable it.

    ```
    vault secrets enable aws
    ```

    By default, all AWS IAM credentials are paired with a lease of 768 hours, after
    which they will be revoked. You should shorten that to 30 minutes by updating
    the lease configuration located at the path `/aws/config/lease`.

    ```
    vault write aws/config/lease lease=30m lease_max=30m
    ```

    At any time during this track, you can view your
    [root token](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens/#root-tokens)
    by running:

    ```
    cat /root/token
    ```

    This token will be valid for the duration of the track. Typically, you'll set
    that token value as your `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable with:

    ```
    export VAULT_TOKEN=$(cat /root/token)
    ```

    If you open up the Vault UI tab and use this token, you can log into the UI and
    take a look around.

      Secrets engines are components which store, generate, or encrypt data. Secrets engines
      are incredibly flexible, so it is easiest to think about them in terms of their function.
      Secrets engines are provided some set of data, they take some action on that data, and
      they return a result.

  teaser: Prepare Vault to generate dynamic AWS credentials.
  assignment: |-
    After enabling the AWS secrets engine, you must configure it to authenticate and
    communicate with AWS. You have been provided AWS credentials, so no need to use
    your own.

    Since you enabled the AWS secrets engine on the default path, you can configure
    AWS by writing to the `aws/config/root` with a command that looks like the following:

    ```
    vault write aws/config/root \
      access_key=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
      secret_key=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
      region=us-west-1
    ```

    Feel free to take a peek inside at the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
    environment variables.

    ```
    echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    ```

    The next step is to configure a role. A role in Vault is a human-friendly
    identifier to an action, that maps to a set of permissions in AWS as well
    as an AWS credential type. When users generate credentials, they are generated
    against this role.

    Vault knows how to create an IAM user via the AWS API, but it does not know what
    permissions, groups, and policies you want to attach to that user. This is where
    roles come in - roles map your configuration options to those API calls.

    In the example command below is an IAM policy that enables all actions on EC2.
    When Vault generates an access key, it will automatically attach this policy.
    The generated access key will have full access to EC2 (as dictated by this
    policy), but not IAM or other AWS services. If you are not familiar with AWS'
    IAM policies, that is okay - just use this one for now.

    You need to map this policy document to a named role. To do that, write to
    `aws/roles/my-role`.

    ```
    vault write aws/roles/my-role \
            credential_type=iam_user \
            policy_document=-<<EOF
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "Stmt1426528957000",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "ec2:*"
          ],
          "Resource": [
            "*"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    EOF
    ```

      Most secrets engines must be configured in advance before they can perform their
      functions. Vault supports three different types of credentials to retrieve from AWS.

      This track focuses on the [`iam_user`](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/aws/#iam_user)
      method, however, you can read more about the
      [other options](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/aws/).

  title: Generate AWS Credentials
  teaser: Generate AWS access key pairs on the fly.
  assignment: |-
    In the last challenge you told Vault "when I ask for a credential for `my-role`,
    create it and attach the IAM policy `{ "Version": "2012..." }`"".

    Before you go any further, take a moment to list all of the users in your AWS
    account using the [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) with:

    ```
    aws iam list-users
    ```

    There should be only one user in the array that you receive back.

    Now, with the AWS secrets engine enabled and configured with your role,
    you can ask Vault to generate an IAM access key pair for that role by reading
    from `aws/creds/my-role`.

    ```
    vault read aws/creds/my-role
    ```

    Once you read from that endpoint, you will have generated new credentials and an
    associated lease.

    That's not the only way to generate credentials, however. You can also do this
    through the Vault UI. Open up the Vault UI and log in with your root token. Remember
    that you can retrieve it using `cat /root/token`.

    Once logged in, click on the "aws/" secret engine, then select "my-role". You want
    your "Credential type" to be "IAM User", then click "Generate". You'll see that just
    like you received on the CLI, you get an access key, a secret key and an associated lease.

    If you list the users in your AWS account now, you should see the users you generated with
    a username prefix of `vault-root-my-role-*`:

    ```
    aws iam list-users
    ```

    You can also see all of the active leases for your role using:

    ```
    vault list sys/leases/lookup/aws/creds/my-role
    ```

      Dynamic secrets are generated when they are accessed. Dynamic secrets do not
      exist until they are read, so there is no risk of someone stealing them or
      another client using the same secrets.

  title: Revoke AWS Credentials
  teaser: Revoke the dynamically generated AWS access key pairs.
  assignment: |-
    Vault will automatically revoke this credential after 30 minutes as we configured,
    but perhaps you want to revoke it early. Once the secret is revoked, the access keys
    are no longer valid.

    List all of the active leases for your role.

    ```
    vault list sys/leases/lookup/aws/creds/my-role
    ```

    You'll want to take each value from that output and create a lease identifier
    that looks like the following, where LEASE_IDENTIFIER_HASH is replaced with a
    that value:

    ```
    aws/creds/my-role/LEASE_IDENTIFIER_HASH
    ```

    With your lease id prepared, run the `vault lease revoke` command:

    ```
    vault lease revoke aws/creds/my-role/LEASE_IDENTIFIER_HASH
    ```

    You should receive a message about your revocation being successfully
    queued. If you look back at the IAM management page, you will no longer
    see the user associated with that lease. If you try to use the access
    keys that were generated, you will find that they no longer work.

    You can verify that the lease has been revoked by listing all of
    the active leases again:

    ```
    vault list sys/leases/lookup/aws/creds/my-role
    ```

    You can also verify the revocations have successfully propagated to AWS with:

    ```
    aws iam list-users
    ```

    Be sure to revoke all leases before trying to complete the exercise.

    With such easy dynamic creation and revocation, you can hopefully begin
    to see how easy it is to work with dynamic secrets and ensure they only
    exist for the duration that they are needed.
