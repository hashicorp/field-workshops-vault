# Lab Environment Used
* This workshop uses [Instruqt](https://instruqt.com) for hands-on labs.
* Instruqt labs are run in "tracks" that are divided into "challenges".
* This workshop uses the following tracks:
    1. **AWS Dynamic Secrets with Vault**
    1. **AWS Auth Method for Vault**
* Your instructor will provide the URL for the tracks.
???
* We will be using Instruqt for the labs.

# Generating Credentials for AWS with Vault
* The [AWS Secrets Engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/aws/) generates AWS access credentials dynamically, based on IAM policies.
* The AWS secrets engine makes working with AWS IAM much easier, since their is no clicking around
a web UI.
* Everything can be scripted and automated.

???
* The AWS secrets engine generates AWS credentials dynamically.

# Generating Credentials for AWS with Vault
* Additionally, the process is codified and mapped to internal auth methods (such as LDAP).
* The AWS IAM credentials are time-based and are automatically revoked when the Vault lease expires.
* Vault can retrieve three types of credentials from AWS:
  * `iam_user`
  * `assumed_role`
  * `federation_token`.

# Generating iam_user Credentials
* Vault will create an IAM user for each lease and attach the managed IAM policies as
specified in the role to the user.
* Vault will then generate an access key and secret key forthe IAM user and return them to the caller.

???
* Here are some details on generating iam_user credentials.

---
name: vault-aws-dynamic-secrets-4
# Generating assumed_role Credentials
* Vault will call `sts:AssumeRole`.
* It will return the access key, secret key, and session
token to the caller.

???
* Here are some details on generating assumed_role  credentials.

---
name: vault-aws-dynamic-secrets-4
# Generating federation_token Credentials
* Vault will call `sts:GetFederationToken`, passing in the supplied AWS policy document.
* It will return the access key, secret key, and session token to the caller.

???
* Here are some details on generating federation_token  credentials.

---
name: vault-aws-dynamic-secrets-5
# Generating Credentials for AWS with Vault
* Most commonly, users leverage the `iam_user` Vault AWS secrets engine.
* This is what we will do in the lab.
* For more information on the
`assumed_role` and `federation_token` secrets engines, review the [STS AssumeRole](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/aws/#sts-assumerole) and the [STS Federation Tokens](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/aws/#sts-credentials) documentation.
