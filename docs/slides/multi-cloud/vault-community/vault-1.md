# HashiCorp Vault Overview
![:scale 10%](https://hashicorp.github.io/field-workshops-assets/assets/logos/logo_vault.png)

  * HashiCorp Vault is an API-driven, cloud agnostic secrets management system.
  * It allows you to safely store and manage sensitive data in hybrid cloud environments.
  * You can also use Vault to generate dynamic short-lived credentials, or encrypt application data on the fly.

???
This is meant as a high level overview.  For detailed descriptions or instructions please see the docs, API guide, or learning site:

# The Traditional Security Model
* Traditional security models were built upon the idea of perimeter based security.
* There would be a firewall, and inside that firewall it was assumed one was safe.
* Resources such as databases were mostly static.  As such rules were based upon IP address, credentials were baked into source code or kept in a static file on disk.

???
This slide discusses the traditional security model

name: problems-with-traditional-security-models
# Problems with the Traditional Security Model
* IP Address based rules
* Hardcoded credentials with problems such as:
  * Shared service accounts for apps and users
  * Difficult to rotate, decommission, and determine who has access
  * Revoking compromised credentials could break

???
* This slide describes some of the problems with the traditional security model.

???
* These are Mongolian Yurts or "Ger" as they are called locally. Instead of a castle with walls and a drawbridge, a fixed fortress that has an inside and an outside, these people move from place to place, bringing their houses with them.

* And if you don't think the Nomadic way can be an effective security posture, think about this for a moment. The Mongol military tactics and organization enabled the Genghis Khan to conquer nearly all of continental Asia, the Middle East and parts of eastern Europe. Mongol warriors would typically bring three or four horses with them, so they could rotate through the horses and go farther. Mongol army units could move up to 100 miles a day, which was unheard of in the 13th century. They were faster, more adaptable, and more resilient than all their enemies.

* Here we see that Vault has multiple means of authenticating users and applications with its Auth Methods.
* Vault can manage many types of secrets and excels at generating short-lived, dynmamic secrets.
* Vault's ACL policies are associated with tokens that users and applications use to access secrets after authenticating.
* Tokens can only read/write secrets that its policies allow.

# Identity Based Security

Vault was designed to address the security needs of modern applications.  It differs from the traditional approach by using:

* Identity based rules allowing security to stretch across network perimeters
* Dynamic, short lived credentials that are rotated frequently
* Individual accounts to maintain provenance (tie action back to entity)
* Credentials and Entities that can easily be invalidated

???
* This slide discusses how Vault is designed for modern applications.
