# Introduction to Vault - Instructor Guide

This guide will prepare you to deliver a half-day [Introduction to Vault Workshop](https://hashicorp.github.io/field-workshops-vault/slides/multi-cloud/vault-community). This workshop content is suitable for HashiCorp community members, prospects and customers. The workshop is a combination of lecture slides and hands-on Instruqt labs that introduce new users to some of Vault's features. This workshop focuses on Community Edition features and is targeted toward new users. The workshop may be presented in-person, over the web, or as a self-guided tutorial.

The workshop alternates between lectures with accompanying slides and hands-on lab exercises. New concepts that are introduced in the slides are reinforced in the labs. Participants will learn both the theory and practice of Vault. As an instructor you should be well familiar with the slide deck and the Instruqt tracks used in the workshop. Go through the course and make sure you understand all of the major concepts and lab exercises.

Note that since July 22, 2020, all of the "Vault Basics" track should be done together after chapter 6. This avoids excessive switching between the main Zoom session and breakout rooms in virtual workshops.

When possible you should attend a live training session to observe and learn from another instructor. We will also have video recordings of this workshop available soon.

### Prerequisites
Prerequisites are minimal. All that is required to participate in the workshop is a web browser and Internet access. No software needs to be downloaded or installed. Self-contained lab environments run on the [Instruqt](https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp) platform, and markdown-based slide decks are published as Github Pages websites.

The Instruqt tracks include terminal tabs that can be used to execute Vault CLI commands. They also include the Vault UI.

All instructors and TAs from HashiCorp should be sure to register themselves with Instruqt and then post a message in our Slack channel, #proj-instruqt, asking to be added to the HashiCorp organization within Instruqt. This is important since only members of the HashiCorp organization can see the useful "Skip to Challenge" button on challenges of tracks within this organization.

### Scheduling your workshop
Please add all workshops, both public and private, to the shared instruqt-workshops Google calendar as follows:

1. Create a new event on the instruqt-workshops calendar and set the name to the name of your workshop which could match a name being used by Field Marketing if it is public or the name of a specific customer and a product if it is private. **Note that this calendar event should be separate from the one you send to workshop attendees.**
2. Set the begin and end times of the event to the begin and end times of your workshop.
3. Include the following information in the description:
    1. The name of the host (probably yourself) after "Host:"
    2. The names of presenters after "Presenters:"
    3. A list of tracks that your workshop will use after "Tracks:", listing the URL of each track on its own line. **Please do not list links to Instruqt invites.**

Before saving the event, be sure to set the calendar as "instruqt-workshops" instead of your own personal calendar.

### Email Invitation
Here is some boilerplate text you can use or customize when inviting or announcing your workshop:

```

```

### Markdown Slide Deck
The slide deck for this training is published here:

#### https://hashicorp.github.io/field-workshops-vault/slides/multi-cloud/vault-community

The optional extension for AWS are here:
#### https://hashicorp.github.io/field-workshops-vault/slides/aws/vault-community

#### Navigation
Use the arrow keys (up/down or left/right) to navigate back and forth between slides.

Press the `P` key to enter presenter mode and reveal the speaker notes.

Press the `C` key to pop open an external window that will stay synced with your speaker notes window. This is useful for keeping notes on your laptop while showing the presentation on the projector.

#### RemarkJS
The slide deck for this training is written completely in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) using the [RemarkJS](https://remarkjs.com/#1) framework. This allows us to publish slide decks from a source code repository. The slide deck is easy to maintain, lightweight, and can be accessed from anywhere. Updates and changes to the deck can be made quickly and efficiently by simply editing the markdown source files. If you find any mistakes or issues with the slides please add them to our issue tracker:

https://github.com/hashicorp/field-workshops-vault/issues

### Hands-on Labs
At certain points in the slide deck there are slides about the lab exercises. [Instruqt](https://instruqt.com/hashicorp) is our lab platform. The slides used to have links to permanent Instruqt invitations, but these have been removed. You must now create and share invites with your students for each workshop as described below.

Participants can register with Instruqt [here](https://play.instruqt.com/signup). Users only need to provide an email and a password. They can then login via email, Google, GitHub, and Twitter.=

Students may have questions during the labs. When presenting a workshop be sure to give enough time for all your participants to go through the labs. Remember that this is probably their first time using a tool like Vault.

As mentioned in the Prerequisites section, all HashiCorp instructors and TAs for workshops should register with Instruqt and then post a message in our Slack channel, #proj-instruqt, asking to be added to the HashiCorp organization in Instruqt.

Members of the HashiCorp organization in Instruqt can hover over any challenge in any track in that organization and see a "Skip to Challenge" button. After starting a track, you can use these buttons to run the track's setup and solve scripts up to the challenge you want to skip to. When skipping to a challenge, always be sure to click the "Normal Skip" button too.

This track covers the Vault CLI and UI, running a dev Vault server and writing a secret to it, using the Vault HTTP API, running a production Vault server, using the KVv2 secrets engine and the Userpass auth method, and Vault policies.

#### Creating Instruqt Invites
Once you've gotten an invite to the HashiCorp organization you can create temporary invite links for your students:

1. Click on the **Invites** tab under https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp. (Note that you must be have the Content Contributor role within the Instruqt HashiCorp organization to create invites. If you don't have that, see this [link](https://hashicorp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SE/pages/511574174/Instruqt+and+Remark+Contributor+Guide#InstruqtandRemarkContributorGuide-GettingAccess).)
2. Click on the **Create** button to create a new invite.
3. Create a descriptive title such as "Acme Vault Workshop".
4. Select the tracks you want to make available. Type the names of the tracks so that they will show up in the filtered list.
5. Leave "How many times can this invite be used?" set to 0.
6. Set the invite to expire in one month.
7. Leave "How many times can the track be played?" set to 0.
8. Make the track available to your user for 1 month.
9. Do not enable the **Allow anonymous** setting if you want to be able to track which users played the track based on their emails.

### Configuring the Instruqt Pools
We recommend that you configure Instruqt pools for each Instruqt track used in this workshop 1 hour before you plan to use the track. Please see this Confluence [doc](https://hashicorp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SE/pages/511574174/Instruqt+and+Remark+Contributor+Guide#InstruqtandRemarkContributorGuide-ConfiguringInstruqtPools) for instructions.

### Timing
The following schedule assumes you have a group of participants who are brand new to Vault. You should budget about four hours for this workshop including a short break. (But in virtual workshops, participants are expected to take breaks during the labs.)

This is meant as a guideline, you can adjust as needed. If you prefer to alternate the slides of the "Interacting with Vault" chapter with the first 3 challenges of the "Vault Basics" track, you can do that.

If you want to cover the optional AWS slides and Instruqt tracks, add 1 hour.
